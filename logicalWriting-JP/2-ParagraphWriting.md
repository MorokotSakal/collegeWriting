Example:

In writing, we should start writing from **summary** to **detail**. First, we state the **summary** by using a **topic sentence**. Then, contents of **topic sentence** is further breakdown into logical block called **paragraph**. After that, each **paragraph** shall start with a **summary sentence**. Finally, after each **summary sentence**, we complete the **detail** by adding additional supporting information. 

#### Expansion type
Use case: introduce element of organization, or feature of something

Example:

This robot take surrounding information by using optical, sound, and touch sensor.
1. Optical: add detail about Camera
2. Sound: add detail about stereo mic
3. Touch: add detail about touch sensor

#### Unified type
Use case: product or service introduction. By putting the produce or service name in front of sentence, we explain about it while making it memorable.
